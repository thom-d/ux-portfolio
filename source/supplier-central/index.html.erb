  <h3>Research and Competitive Analysis</h3>
  <p class="about-content">
     The preparation timeline before development was fairly short. I made the decision to focus on understanding the business requirements, and performing a competitive analysis. I reviewed companies such as Walmart, Amazon, Sears and Zulily. I also developed a user flow to guide the application journey and various scenarios.
     <br>
     <br>
     What I discovered, is that many vendor portal solutions are either overly complex or lacking in functionality. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Key Approach: Create a platform that was simple and easy to access. 
  </p>

  <h3>Prototyping and User Testing</h3>
  <p class="about-content">
     Working with the business, I was able to secure two vendor partners to test with. For this, I created an InVision prototype for the users to click through. I observed and noted any questions, hesitations other behaviors. After the observation, I was able to interview our users for more feedback.
     <br>
     <br>
     Key Discovery: The platform was easy to use, but some of the labels and functionality needed more clarity.
  </p>

  <h3>UI Design, Production and Follow Up</h3>
  <p class="about-content">
     Supplier Central today, features a central dashboard where SaaS solutions will soon be available. It also houses essential documents for vendor engagement. 
     <br>
     At the request of the business, a follow up user feedback forum was conducted. Unfortunately, there was not enough functionality in production to yield strong feedback.
     <br>
     <br>
     Future State: More functionality may be added to Supplier Central, but that is currently under review.
