  <h3>What is Charlie, and what does it have to do with Google Home?</h3>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p class="about-content">
     Earlier in spring 2017, a concept landing page had been created as part of a proposal for the Charlie digital assistant endeavor. In fall 2017, the project was given the greenlight with a very small timeline. As part of that, I was tasked with designing a new, updated landing page that would be quickly spun up in the Wordpress environment. My delivery timeline? About a day and a half. 
     <br>
     <br>
With such a short timeline, I immediately began to conduct some inspiration research online. I knew I wanted to take the existing brand aesthetic, and elevate and refine it for this landing page. The project and product are exciting. The promotional piece should match. That meant a clear focus on the product, balancing clean typography and layout with bold (and darker) colors than normal. This would be a relatively new aesthetic for the client. 
While visuals are a language and vehicle, content is the substance. Working with our Marketing content team, I was able to design a flow and craft a layout around the content and what we wanted to say.
		 <br>
     <br> 

		 <strong>The Goal:</strong> Rapidly stand up a new product landing page that was scalable for future features and additions such as - blogging, callouts for new Charlie features, a Get Started guide, and more.
